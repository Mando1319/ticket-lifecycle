In this lab, I will create a ticket as an end user, observe all the ticket properties, and respond to them as a help desk professional. So, I began as an end user and created a ticket with the following issue: The entire mobile/online banking system was down. Also, as a help desk agent under the name of John, I observed the ticket's properties, such as the ticket's priority, Department, and SLA, and to which this ticket is assigned such as the agent who will work on the ticket. Furthermore, I have set the properties of SLA to Sev-A and set this issue to the online banking department. Moreover, I worked the ticket to completion as Jane another agent who was also part of the online banking team decided to work on this ticket herself. the root cause was the recent update, so it was rolled back, the vendor was notified, but we are still waiting for a proper fix, but the online banking should be now up and running, so the ticket was resolved.

As an end-user, I created the following ticket, (the accounting department needs Adobe upgrade, broken), so right after Also an a help desk agent under the name of john, I observed the ticket's properties and set some of the properties such as setting the SLA to Sev-C and making sure the ticket was sent to the support department. The issue was that the accounting department couldn't use the Adobe software, only 2 people could not use the software, and was categorized as a Sev-C ticket, the Cx tested if restarting would fix the issue and it appeared to have worked so the ticket was resolved. There was a third ticket about a CFO's laptop not powering on This ticket was set to Sev-B but could have been Sev-A depending if there was any update on the urgency of the problem, so the ticket was being worked on by John Doe a support agent. the issue was the charger was broken so he bought a new one and the laptop started charging so the ticket was resolved.
