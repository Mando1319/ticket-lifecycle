In this lab, I am currently using a Windows 10 Operating System using the Azure cloud platform to run a virtual machine, while also running the osTicket software. As an end user, I will create a ticket, observe all the ticket properties, and respond to them as a help desk professional. So, I began as an end user and created a ticket with the following issue: The entire mobile/online banking system was down. Also, as a help desk agent under my name, I observed the ticket's properties, such as the ticket's priority, Department, and SLA, and to which this ticket is assigned such as the agent who will work on the ticket. Furthermore, I have set the properties of SLA to Sev-A and assigned this issue to the online banking department. Moreover, I worked the ticket to completion as Jane another agent who was also part of the online banking team decided to work on this ticket herself. Briefly, Jane diagnosed the root cause was the recent update to the online banking systems, so it was rolled back to see if this would fix the issue and it did, The vendor was notified, and the online banking should be up and running, so the ticket status was marked as resolved.

As an end-user under the name Ken, I created the following ticket, (the accounting department needs Adobe upgrade, broken) as a help desk agent under the name of John, I observed the ticket's properties and set some of the properties such as setting the SLA to Sev-C and making sure the ticket was sent to the support department. The issue was that the accounting department couldn't use the Adobe software, specifically 2 people could not use the software, which was already categorized as a Sev-C ticket also Sev-C is a not-so-trivial categorization level compared to Sev-B which makes it a bit more important than Sev-C and would require a sooner time frame to complete, while Sev-A requires immediate attention about an hour or less to resolve. the Cx tested if restarting would fix the issue and it appeared to have fixed the inability to use the Adobe software, so the ticket was resolved.

The third and final ticket was about a CFO's laptop not powering on. This ticket was set to Sev-B but could have been Sev-A depending on any update on the problem's urgency, so the ticket was being worked on by John Doe a support agent. The issue was that the CFO's laptop was not powering on even though the CFO stated that he charged it before starting his work, In essence, it was diagnosed that the charger was broken so he bought a new one and the laptop started charging. After the ticket status was marked as resolved.
